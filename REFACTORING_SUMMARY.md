# Task Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The large `tasks.py` file has been successfully refactored into a modular structure for better maintainability and organization.

## New Structure

```
app/services/tasks/
├── __init__.py              # Package initialization and task imports
├── utils.py                 # Shared utilities and helper functions
├── discovery_task.py        # Task 1: WebSocket trader discovery
├── tracking_task.py         # Task 2: Trader position tracking
└── leaderboard_task.py      # Task 3: Leaderboard calculation and scoring
```

## File Descriptions

### `__init__.py`

- Package initialization file
- Imports all tasks to make them available when the package is imported
- Provides a clean interface for external imports

### `utils.py`

- Shared helper functions used across multiple tasks
- Contains:
  - `get_db()`: Database session management
  - `get_or_create_trader()`: Trader creation utility
  - `detect_position_changes()`: Position change detection logic

### `discovery_task.py`

- **Task 1**: WebSocket-based trader discovery
- Contains:
  - `task_manage_discovery_stream()`: Main Celery task
  - `_manage_discovery_stream_async()`: WebSocket connection management
  - `_process_trade_messages()`: Trade message processing logic

### `tracking_task.py`

- **Task 2**: Batched trader position tracking
- Contains:
  - `task_track_traders_batch()`: Main Celery task
  - `_track_traders_batch_async()`: Batch processing logic
  - Redis pub/sub integration for real-time updates

### `leaderboard_task.py`

- **Task 3**: Leaderboard calculation and trader scoring
- Contains:
  - `task_calculate_leaderboard()`: Main Celery task
  - `_calculate_individual_metrics()`: Individual metric calculation
  - `_calculate_trader_scores()`: Normalization and weighted scoring
  - `_get_default_metrics()`: Default metric values
  - `_save_trader_metrics()`: Database persistence

## Updated Files

### `celery_app.py`

- Updated task includes to point to individual task files
- Updated beat schedule task names to include full module paths

### Test Files

- Updated imports in test files to use new modular structure:
  - `test/run_discovery_task.py`
  - `test/test_tracking_task.py`
  - `test/test_leaderboard_task.py`

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Better Organization**: Each task is in its own focused file
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to one task don't affect others
3. **Improved Readability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand
4. **Better Testing**: Each task can be tested independently
5. **Code Reuse**: Shared utilities are centralized in `utils.py`
6. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each file has a single responsibility

## Migration Notes

- The old `tasks.py` file has been renamed to `tasks_old.py` as a backup
- All existing functionality has been preserved
- Task scheduling and execution remain unchanged
- All imports have been updated to use the new structure

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding task-specific configuration files
2. Add more comprehensive logging per task
3. Implement task-specific error handling and retry logic
4. Add performance monitoring for each task type
5. Consider adding task-specific unit tests
