# Task Flow Testing Summary

## Task 1: WebSocket Trader Discovery

**Status: WORKING**

- Fixed issue with processing trade messages - the code was looking for a "user" field but the actual WebSocket messages have a "users" array
- Successfully tested with run_discovery_task.py
- Task connects to WebSocket, subscribes to trade feeds, and processes trade messages to extract trader addresses
- Task successfully discovered and added new traders to the database

## Task 2: Trader Tracking

**Status: WORKING**

- Successfully tested with test_tracking_task.py
- Task retrieves trader information from the Hyperliquid API in batches
- State histories are created for each trader
- Trader's last_tracked_at timestamp is updated after processing

## Task 3: Leaderboard Calculation

**Status: WORKING**

- Fixed issue with timezone-aware datetime comparison
- Successfully tested with test_leaderboard_task.py
- Task calculates and updates metrics for all traders
- Leaderboard metrics include account age and trade volume

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. Add better error handling and retry logic for the WebSocket connection
2. Implement more advanced position change detection logic
3. Add more comprehensive metrics for the leaderboard (win rate, risk ratio, etc.)
4. Create monitoring and alerting for task failures
5. Implement rate limiting for API calls to Hyperliquid

## Overall Assessment

All three tasks are now working correctly. The system can:

1. Discover traders through WebSocket data
2. Track trader positions and state
3. Calculate metrics for the leaderboard

The fixes applied were:

1. Correcting the trade message processing logic to handle "users" array
2. Ensuring datetime objects are timezone-compatible when calculating trader age
